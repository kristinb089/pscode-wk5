// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

X = 2
Y = 3

Sum = X + Y

print(sum)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Print "Enter number"
Number = x

If (x % 2 == 0)
Then 
Print "Even"
Else
Print "Odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

A = 1
B = 2
C = 3
D = 4
E = 5

Sum = A + B + C + D + E
Avg = Sum/5

Min(A, B, C, D, E)
Max(A, B, C, D, E)

Print "Avg: " Avg
Print "Min: " Min
Print "Max: " Max

Avg: 3
Min: 1
Max: 5
